# Deep Dungeon Map Solver

This program can accept a graphical text-based map from the Unofficial Squaresoft MUD, and solve it by finding a route through the map. This is only compatible with maps from the Deep Dungeon area of the game.

For more details, see the Docs folder, where there is a spec of this map, samples, and a generalized algorithm for solving them.
